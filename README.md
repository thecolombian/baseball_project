Project Documentation
1. Project Overview
This project involves building a simple web application that lists baseball players and their stats from the Sample APIs baseball data. The application should correct any missing data on ranking in terms of hits per season, display player descriptions generated by an LLM (Large Language Model), and allow users to edit player data.

2. Technologies Used
Front End: React
Server Side: Python
Database: PostgreSQL
3. Project Steps and Code Documentation
Front End: React

Setup React Project

Initialize a new React project.
Install necessary dependencies: axios for API calls, react-router-dom for routing, and material-ui for UI components.
Create Components

PlayerList: Fetches and displays a list of players along with their stats.
PlayerDetails: Shows detailed information about a player, including an LLM-generated description.
EditPlayer: Allows editing of player data.
API Integration

Use axios to fetch data from the Sample APIs baseball data endpoint.
Correct missing data on ranking in terms of hits per season within the fetched data.
Routing

Implement routing to navigate between the PlayerList, PlayerDetails, and EditPlayer components.

You have to run the follolwing with the correct order 
export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
node server.js
npm start 

to kill the node server - lsof -i :5001

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
